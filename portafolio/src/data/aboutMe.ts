  "I'm a 23-year-old software developer from Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, with a strong background in coding and real-world problem-solving. I started programming in 2020, and since then, I've been drawn to building efficient, meaningful solutions through code. What began as curiosity has turned into a clear professional direction.",
  "I graduated with a 3.98 GPA from the Instituto Tecnológico de Las Américas (ITLA), where I developed solid technical skills in programming, web technologies, and database management. Outside of academics, I’ve taken part in challenging development environments, contributing to projects where clean code and functionality matter. I enjoy tackling logic and algorithm challenges from time to time, as a way to stay sharp and think outside the box.",
  "Over time, I’ve had the opportunity to be involved in professional work that tested both my technical and collaborative skills. I’m now focused on contributing to innovative teams, delivering quality software, and continuing to grow with every challenge that comes my way."
